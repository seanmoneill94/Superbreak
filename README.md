# Superbreak
IOS development, Assignment 2
Description
In the game Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the
screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away
and the brick is destroyed. We plan on creating a re-imagined version of this game for iOS with the
possibility for local versus mode. The artwork will be simple, enabling us to focus more on creating a
robust system.

Requirements/objectives
  - Navigation through multiple screens
    o Menu system will include settings, as well as multiple levels (scaling in difficulty as well as other variables).
  - Graphics and animations
    o Movement of the pad, and the removal of blocks in addition to the UI which will track score, time, etc.
  - Use of device APIs
    o The app will use the accelerometer/gyroscope, if the setting is enabled, to move the pad left or right.
  - Gestures
    o Game will employ ‘power-ups’ will be activated with the use of multitouch gestures. The game will also allow two players locally, each working away at the same block and fighting for the highest score.
  - Handling data
    o The game will save its state for each player (wins, losses, high score etc.).
  - Web services
    o App will allow the player to post their score to facebook, twitter, etc.
    
End Product
The final product will be a multiple level breakout style game which will allow for multiplayer in
versus mode, the accelerometer to be used for controlling the movement of the platform. Points will
be stored and can be shared on various social media platforms.
